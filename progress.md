### Key Decisions Made
1. Your data always free - neighbor data is premium
2. Gamification core to engagement
3. Local-first architecture
4. MeterPi as hardware upsell
5. Citizen science framing
6. 5-home minimum for privacy

### Next Session Goals
1. Complete all iOS Views
2. Build FastAPI backend
3. Create landing page
4. Test in Docker sandbox
